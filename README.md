# Iris-Flower-Model

## Python project that involved the usage of the popular iris dataset pulled from Kaggle.
The objective was to train a decision tree model to predict the species of flower based on characteristics

### 3 Species Involved:
Iris-setosa
Iris-vericolor
Iris-virginica

### Characteristics Involved:
SepalWidthCm
PetalLengthCm
SepalLengthCm

### Compared petal ratios, petal length, and sepal length between the 3 species using scatterplots and iceborn distribution plots

### Created 3 different types of decision tree models based on all the data, petal only data, and sepal only data using 20% of the dataset as test data

### Testing the Models
Ran each type of model 100 times
The model that had all the data performed at least 95% accuracy
The model that had petal only data performed at least 95% accuracy
The model that had sepal only data performed poorly in the 60% range

### Takeaways
The 3 species cannot be determined distinctively by only looking at sepal charactistics.
Analyzing petal characteristics or both petal and sepal charactistics showed that each flower can be properly be idenitified.
